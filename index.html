        <p>Hi! My name is Hailey, but most people online know me as Biscuit. The name started as a small joke with friends, but it stuck because it fits me. It's also simple and creative. I use Biscuit on the internet to keep some privacy while still being myself and it's kind of become my online identity. I'm in my second-year Multimedia Production student at Lethbridge Polytechnic in Lethbridge, Alberta. I love working on art, illustration, design, and photography, and I'm always looking for new ways to be creative. The little wizard character I'm holding in the art piece is my cartoon character version of myself. A lot of people through online recongnize me by that design on my social media and it's a fun way to show my personailty. i've also worked on projects like (Re)Surface Pt. 2 and helped create a logo for an upcoming brand. One of my favourtie movies is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327597/" target="_blank"> Coraline</a>. This movie is stop-motion and was released in 2009. I love it's unqiue style, imaginative world, and how it tells a story in such a creative way.

                Here is where you could see some of my art pieces that I made and the photographys I have taken. Most of them where either from last year or this year,<br> 

                <br>Most of my art pieces were made using ibisPaint X on my iPhone or iPad. I also use Adobe Illustrator on my iMac, I like trying different styles and using digital tools to bring my ideas to life.<br>
                
                <br>For my photography, I take most of my pictures with my Canon camera and sometimes with my iPhone. I enjoy capturing moments, places, and things that stand out to me.

            <p>I recently had an opportunity to be part of the (Re)Surface Pt 2 project, and it's been such a cool experience. I got involved when they reached out to me through social media, asking if I wanted to contribute to this public art project. The idea was that artists would create a collaborative piece using a large photo of a wall in Lethbridge as our canvas. I was totally on board! For this project, I created a piece called "Moonlight Serenity." I used Ibis Paint X and Adobe Illustrator to bring it to life. It was amazing to see my digital creation become part of something bigger, something that connects with the community.The finished artworks were showcased in a pop-up art gallery, and my piece was displayed at the Trianon Gallery. It's now moving to another art museum here in Lethbridge, which is super exciting! I'm also going to be part of a film about the project, where I'll get to talk about my artwork, why I wanted to be involved, and what I love about the arts scene in Lethbridge. Being part of (Re)Surface Pt 2 has really highlighted for me how vibrant and supportive the art community is here, and I'm so grateful to be a part of it.</p>

            <p>I worked on designing the logo for a new brand called Velvet Kisses. The goal was to create a logo that really fit the brand and showed its personality. I spent time thinking about the style, colors, and shapes that would make it stand out and feel memorable. I wanted the logo to feel simple but special, something people would recognize easily.It was a really fun project because I got to explore different ideas and try out different designs until I found one that felt right. Working on this logo also helped me practice my design skills and gave me experience creating something for a real brand. I enjoyed seeing how my ideas could turn into a final design that the brand can use. For making the logos, I used ibisPaint X and Illustrator.</p>
